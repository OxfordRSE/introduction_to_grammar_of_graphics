This question is more open ended and invites you to graphically investigate the full suicide trends data (I only showed a portion of this in class). Questions that could be investigated include:

- What are the overall trends in suicide counts / per capita?
- How do these vary according to country, region and age group?
- Is there any link between suicide trends and GDP per capita?
