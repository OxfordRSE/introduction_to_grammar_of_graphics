In this problem set, we are going to visualise a dataset from Gapminder, which contains data on life expectancy, GDP per capita and population by country. For more information, see http://www.gapminder.org/data/.

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2)
library(gapminder)
```

Load the `gapminder.csv` data
- note, in Python, import the data using pandas
```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("../data/gapminder.csv")
```

Examine the first 10 rows of your dataset
```{r}
head(gapminder)
```
