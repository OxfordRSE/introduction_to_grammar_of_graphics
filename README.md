# Introduction to scalable visualisation using the grammar of graphics paradigm
This course provides a half day introduction to visualisation using the grammar of graphics approach. In the course, participants will learn:

- how the traditional approach to visualisation differs to the grammar of graphics one
- how grammar of graphics allows for agile exploration of hierarchical datasets
- what aesthetics are and why the speed the search for good visualisations
- how facets can produce clean visualisations

The course consists of a short [lecture](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_grammar_of_graphics/blob/main/presentations/grammar_of_graphics_visualisation.html) and a problem set.

The exercise within the problem set invites participants to visualise gapminder data.

The best reference for this course is the ggplot2 book by Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen which is [freely available online](https://ggplot2-book.org/).
